# Growlist App
This project is for an Android app (iOS as well, if time allows) to keep track of collections of plants. Major features include being able to add/delete items, view the list, view details about a specific item, and export the list to a format that can be used on PCs. 

The Main page will include a list of all items currently in the database, as well as a link to add items. Later versions will add a menu to delete an item from the database, export the database, and set filters on items displayed. Ideally, an option to search the database and show only matching results in the list would be added. 

List items will include the Genus and species (as well as ssp, var, etc., if applicable). Clicking on a list item will bring up a detail list showing more information, such as date acquired, age, value/purchase price, quantity, sex (if the plant is dioecious), and other items as appropriate. If time allows, a feature to add a picture will be added. At the very least this would allow a user to import an image from the gallery, but ideally will allow for the user to either import an existing picture or open the camera and take a picture to be stored directly. 

Initial development will be done for Android in Android Studio. If Android development goes smoothly, members of the team may be moved onto iOS development to begin work on an app for Apple devices while the other team members continue adding features to the Android version.
